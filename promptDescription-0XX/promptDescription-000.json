The program should allow multiple threads to access and process the files simultaneously, while ensuring data integrity and avoiding deadlocks.\nQuestion:\nWrite a program that implements a concurrent file processing system with the following requirements:\nThe program should allow multiple threads to access and process files in a shared directory.\nEach file should be processed by only one thread at a time to maintain data integrity.",
